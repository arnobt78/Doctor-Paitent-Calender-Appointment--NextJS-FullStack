## Mathematical & Logical Calculations

- **Date Grouping:** Appointments are grouped by date using JavaScript date-fns utilities, allowing for efficient rendering and logical separation in List view.
- **Filtering & Search:** All filtering and search logic is performed in-memory for instant feedback. Search matches across multiple fields (title, notes, patient name, etc.), and filters are combined using logical AND.
- **Color Assignment:** Categories and avatars use a deterministic color assignment based on a hash of the string, ensuring consistent color-coding across sessions.
- **Responsive Layout:** Uses flexbox and Tailwind utilities for dynamic, mathematical layout calculations (e.g., min/max widths, gap, flex-basis) to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.
- **Status Calculation:** Appointment status (done, pending, alert) is calculated and displayed based on the current date and appointment data.

---

## Supabase Database Schema & Relationships

The project uses a normalized relational schema in Supabase PostgreSQL. Below are the main tables and their relationships:

### Tables & Types

- **categories**: Appointment categories (label, description, color, icon)
- **patients**: Patient records (name, birth date, care level, pronoun, email, etc.)
- **appointments**: Main appointment table (title, notes, start/end, location, patient, category, attachments, status)
- **relatives**: Relatives of patients
- **appointment_assignee**: Links appointments to users (patients or relatives)
- **activities**: Activity log for appointments (type, content)

### TypeScript Types

```ts
export type UUID = string;

// Patient
export interface Patient {
  id: UUID;
  firstname: string;
  lastname: string;
  birth_date: string;
  care_level: number;
  pronoun: string;
  email: string;
  active: boolean;
  active_since: string;
  created_at: string;
}

// Relative
export interface Relative {
  id: UUID;
  created_at: string;
  firstname: string;
  lastname: string;
  pronoun: string;
  notes: string;
}

// Category
export interface Category {
  id: UUID;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string | null;
  label: string;
  description: string;
  color: string;
  icon: string;
}

// Appointment
export interface Appointment {
  id: UUID;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string | null;
  start: string;
  end: string;
  location: string;
  patient: UUID;
  attachements: string[]; // Assuming array of URLs or filenames
  category: UUID;
  notes: string;
  title: string;
  status?: "done" | "pending" | "alert"; // Optional status field added
}

// Appointment Assignee
export interface AppointmentAssignee {
  id: UUID;
  created_at: string;
  appointment: UUID;
  user: UUID;
  user_type: "relatives" | "patients";
}

// Activity
export interface Activity {
  id: UUID;
  created_at: string;
  created_by: UUID;
  appointment: UUID;
  type: string;
  content: string;
}
```

### Example Data

```sql
-- Sample Category
INSERT INTO categories (label, description, color, icon)
VALUES
('Arzttermin', 'Arztbesuche und medizinische Termine', '#3498db', 'stethoscope'),
('Pflegeeinsatz', 'Pflegeeinsatz durch Pflegekraft', '#2ecc71', 'user-nurse');

-- Sample Patient
INSERT INTO patients (firstname, lastname, birth_date, care_level, pronoun, email, active, active_since)

```

### Query Example

```sql
SELECT
  a.*,
  c.label AS category_label,
  p.firstname AS patient_firstname,
  p.lastname AS patient_lastname,
  aa.user AS assignee_user,
  act.type AS activity_type,
  act.content AS activity_content
FROM appointments a
LEFT JOIN categories c ON a.category = c.id
LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patient = p.id
LEFT JOIN appointment_assignee aa ON aa.appointment = a.id
LEFT JOIN activities act ON act.appointment = a.id;
```

### Attachments & Storage

- **Public Bucket:** All appointment attachments (PDFs, images, etc.) are stored in a Supabase public bucket named `attachments`.
- **Attachment Field:** The `attachements` field in the `appointments` table is an array of filenames/URLs referencing files in the bucket.
- **Migration Utility:**

```sql
UPDATE appointments
SET attachements = ARRAY(
  SELECT regexp_replace(f, '^attachments/', '') FROM unnest(attachements) AS f
)
WHERE attachements IS NOT NULL;
```

### Storage Policies

- **Policy 1:** Allow read access to all users for public files in the `attachments` bucket.
- **Policy 2:** Allow write access only to authenticated users (future-proof for JWT auth).

  - Fields: title, notes, location, category, patient, status, attachments, activities, assignees.

- **API:**
  - `/api/appointments/route.ts` handles appointment CRUD via Supabase.

---

## API & Routing

- **API Route:**

  - `/api/appointments/route.ts` (RESTful endpoints for appointments)

- **App Routes:**
  - `/` (main calendar)
  - All routing handled by Next.js App Router.

---

## Customization & Extensibility

- **Add More Fields:** Extend types in `src/types/types.ts` and update forms/components.

## Future Roadmap

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Add JWT-based authentication (Supabase Auth or custom) so only authenticated users can access their own calendar and appointments.
  - Restrict all routes and API endpoints to authorized users only.
  - Each user will only see and manage their own appointments, patients, and related data.
- **User Roles:**
  - Add support for doctors, nurses, and other staff, with role-based access control.
- **Patient/Doctor Management:**
  - Add dedicated pages for managing patients, doctors, and relatives, based on the current schema.
- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - Enable real-time updates for appointments and notifications.
- **More Integrations:**
  - Add calendar export, reminders, and more.
